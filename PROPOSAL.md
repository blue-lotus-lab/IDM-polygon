### DApp Proposal: EVM IDM (Input Data Messages)

#### Proposal Overview
We propose the development of a DApp similar to Ethereum IDM (Input Data Messages) that allows for internal messaging on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) where the DApp runs. This DApp will be compatible with all EVM blockchains and will be ready to use on both mainnet and testnet.

#### Milestones
1. **UI/UX**: Develop a user-friendly interface for each EVM blockchain, similar to a blockchain block explorer.
2. **DApp Compatibility**: Ensure the DApp is compatible with EVM opcodes to ensure seamless integration.
3. **Gas Optimization**: Optimize gas usage to minimize transaction costs.

#### Creator Team
The DApp will be developed by the Blue Lotus team, consisting of members from lotuschain.org. The core members include:
- @**mosi**: Blockchain Engineer
- @**sepehr**: Web3 Developer, DevOps
- @**omid**: Web3 Developer, Frontend

#### Roadmap and Timeline
- **Beta Release on Testnet**: 30 days after receiving funding.
- **Mainnet Launch**: 60 days after receiving funding.

#### Additional Features (Future Additions)
> Not promise these features at all. But we can do it with new proposal for fundraising.
1. **IDM Explorer**: Develop an explorer to browse and search through IDM messages.
2. **Private Messaging**: Implement a feature for private messaging within the DApp.
3. **Send Funds with Text Messages**: Enable users to send funds along with a text message, creating use cases for public ledgers.
